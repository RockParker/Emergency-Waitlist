# Triage App / Emergency Waitlist

The general outline for this app is that a client/patient should be able to view information related to their case, where an administrator should be able to view information about all patients

## Fonts and Colours
### Fonts
I just want to use a standard font which should be supported on majority of devices which may try to connect to the app

### Colours
For color there are 2 main targets
  1) General Theme
  2) Informative Colouring

#### General Theme
For the general theme of the system, I would like to have a spread of orange, red and some darker blue-ish colouring.
I chose this theme because I like the colours and wanted to experiment with them
Sample Colours (not finalized)
colour #B31312
colour #EA906C
colour #F5EDF7
colour #2B2A4C
colour #222

#### Informative Colouring
This is where the colour will make it easier for a user to see, at a glance, some important general information. 
e.g. If a patient is waiting longer than some accepted average wait time, than the admin/nurse would see that patient's information light up in red. Patients should see the colour green when things are on track or ahead of schedule so that they feel better about the wait time.
